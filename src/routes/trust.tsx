          This page is maintained by Planning Opsboard to answer common security and privacy
          questions about the application. It describes current, app-visible controls and is not
          an independent certification.

      <div className="space-y-10">
        <Section title="Access & authentication">
          <p>
            Access requires an authenticated account. Sessions are managed by our authentication
            provider; all protected routes verify a valid session on every request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Permissions are enforced server-side through role-based access control. Roles are
            stored in a dedicated table and checked through a security-definer function so a user
            cannot grant themselves elevated privileges from the client.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Platform & hosting">
          <p>
            The application runs on the Lovable platform with a managed Postgres database. Row
            Level Security is enabled on user-data tables and scoped to the signed-in user or
            their assigned role. Platform features are provided by Lovable; this page is not a
            Lovable-issued certification.

        </Section>

        <Section title="Data collection & use">
          <p>
            We store the operational data required to run the product: organization records,
            contracts, receivables, expenses, and the profile information you provide. Data is
            used only to operate the features you see in the app and to support your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensitive partner identifiers (such as tax IDs) are restricted to administrators and
            directors and are never exposed to auditor-role accounts.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Subprocessors & integrations">
          <p>
            We rely on Lovable (application hosting, database, authentication) and may integrate
            with third-party systems you connect (for example, Pipedrive, Pipefy, Omie). Data sent
            to a connected system is governed by that provider's terms.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Retention & deletion">
          <p>
            Operational records are retained while your account is active. To request export or
            deletion of your data, contact us at the address below.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Privacy requests & contact">
          <p>
            For privacy requests, security questions, or to report a vulnerability, contact the
            project owner through your usual Planning Opsboard channel. Please include enough
            detail for us to reproduce or act on the request.

        <Section title="Changes to this page">
          <p>
            This page is editable content owned by Planning Opsboard and may be updated as the
            product evolves. Check back for the latest information.
